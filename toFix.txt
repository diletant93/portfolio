1) when we set an item to the local storage, especially
the theme for the mode , we save it as a json string , so we 
get "dark"  and when we are trying to retrieve it we 
get into the class : ""dark"" that's why it doesnt work
Check if we can fix this without the additional removeTheQuotes utill function

2) fix the scrollbar: when we click the theme selector the scrollbar disappears
and goes back when the selector goes inactive

3)click on the theme selector , and when click on anywhere else 
we see this strange grey border and if we click again
somewhere we can see our correct border

4)set theme. It's better that we explicitly limit what we can set to theme (we need
to set only the THEME_VALUES)

!2)add the actual registration and login: step by step watch the guide how to do that with suppabase:
    a)do that using axios so do that by using the direct endpoints
    b)do not forget to commit the small changes
    
!3)If we are good we can try to implement multipage registration


t!)add the styles on the toast for just a simple notification and for an error
