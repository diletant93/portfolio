1) when we set an item to the local storage, especially
the theme for the mode , we save it as a json string , so we 
get "dark"  and when we are trying to retrieve it we 
get into the class : ""dark"" that's why it doesnt work
Check if we can fix this without the additional removeTheQuotes utill function


2) we need to add the slice with the mode
so when it changes , the useEffect fires and changes
the class for the body
